A Minecraft mod that splits screenshots into multiple layers.
Now you can go and retroactively hide the GUI or hot bar from view in your screenshots.

## Usage

Once installed, a new keybind will be added to the list.
You may want to unbind the default take screenshot key and bind <kbd>F2</kbd> to Screenshot Layer's capture binding.
One of the few mainstream image formats that supports multiple layers is the Tagged Image File Format (.tif), so that's what Screenshot Layers outputs.
If you open one of these files in Photoshop, PhotoPea, GIMP, or another image editor, you can view and modify the individual layers separately.
