A Minecraft mod that splits screenshots into multiple layers so you can retroactively hide the GUI or hot bar from view in your screenshots

<!-- Not using normal heading tags because the underline overlaps with the right-aligned image :/ -->
<ins>**Usage**</ins>

Once installed, a new keybind will be added to the list.
You may want to unbind the default take screenshot key and bind <kbd>F2</kbd> to Screenshot Layer's capture binding.
Screenshot Layers outputs .tiff files, as it's one of the few mainstream image formats that supports multiple layers.
If you open one of these files in Photoshop, [PhotoPea](https://www.photopea.com), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org), or another image editor, you can view and modify the individual layers separately.

<ins>**Layers**</ins>

Not every layer will be added to every screenshot, only the ones that are diffrent from the others.
For example the overlay layer will only show if the player has some overlay from a carved pumpkin, power snow, or a potion.
Optional layers are denoted with an asterisk.
