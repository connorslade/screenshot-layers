# Screenshot Layers

A Minecraft mod that splits screenshots into multiple layers.
Now you can go and retroactively hide the GUI or hot bar from view in your screenshots.

## Usage

Once installed, a new keybind will be added to the list.
You may want to unbind the default take screenshot key and bind <kbd>F2</kbd> to Screenshot Layer's capture binding.
One of the few mainstream image formats that supports multiple layers is the Tagged Image File Format (.tif), so that's what screenshot-layers outputs.
If you open one of these files in Photoshop, PhotoPea, Gimp, or another image editor, you can view and modify the individual layers separately.
